Defend our Juries (DoJ) appears to have been founded to protest the crackdown on jurors' right to acquit for any reason (often referred to as jury nullification, and especially pertinent in cases of protest offences).[^doj-about]
However, more recently, they have been at the head of protests against the terrorist designation (proscription) of Palestine Action.[^proscription]
While I do not take issue with this cause (in fact, I support it), I do take issue with their methods.

## Positionality & Risk
As the police *love* to repeat, terrorism convictions carry a whole host of consequences, as do arrest and custody.
These consequences are, of course, worse for members of marginalised groups.
But do DoJ make this clear in any of their materials? No, of course not!
When I pointed this out to them over email, they brushed it off.

I said (type-edited for display):

Their response was:
> I understand your concern re: "the badge of honour stuff", but ultimately, what is at the heart of this campaign is the need to take the law less seriously, especially when those in power are giving us less reason to do so every day. 
> This is really at the core of civil disobedience, and especially this campaign.

> Now this is not to say that breaking terrorism law is something to take lightly, the law/police are capable of enacting serious violence here, as you say informed consent v. important.

I can say for certain that:
1. There is nothing on positionality in the briefing call other than very minimal lip service, and
2. Nothing of this sort exists within the most recent briefing document at the time of writing.

I would argue that the lack of this vital information means that people are unable to give informed consent to take part in the action.

## The Action Itself

### The Offence
You would think that a group called "Defend our Juries" would design their action around an offence that is triable by jury.
Alas, no.

Early in the campaign, some arrests (and subsequent raids) were made under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (TA), but the police (especially the MET) have since moved to only citing section 13 TA.
Notably, an offence under section 13 TA is summary only, whereas section 12 TA is triable either way; it would also be relatively simple to design a similar action around the offence under section 11 TA (also triable either way).

Of course, indictable offences carry greater risk, allowing for stronger punishment and house raids.
Breaking the law, especially terrorism law, is not something that should be taken lightly.

Speaking purely tactically, though, a magistrate's offence is a bad idea.
For one, there is far less subjectivity when being tried by a single magistrate, as opposed to a jury.
Secondly, if the idea was to challenge the legal system, trial by magistrate will not to that; it is entirely foreseeable that the CPS and judiciary could establish a "fasttrack" to handle these cases quickly.

### The Media Approach
Much of the media published by DoJ draws on emotional responses to seeing elderly and visibly disabled people get arrested.
In fairness, it is harrowing to see an old lady be carried away unceremoniously by four cops.

But the question is whether this is productive, or is it fetishising and objectifying disabilities and those with them?
