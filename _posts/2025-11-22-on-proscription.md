The proscription of Palestine Action was clearly a political act on behalf of the israel lobby; it was unjust and intended to further crack down on dissent; it should be overturned as soon as possible.
However, it is also just stupid.

For proscription to be effective, the group it targets must have a reliance on its name.
For traditional or foreign "terrorist" groups,[^defining] this works because there is a movement behind the name and/or no reason for them to be concerned about UK law.
However, for Palestine Action, the movement was one of shutting down the israeli war machine.
The name, truly, did not mean as much as their prime slogan "Shut Elbit Down".

Also, with its cell-like structure, Palestine Action did not have "members" in the way that the Terrorism Act 2000 but -- moreso -- acted as a movement, a face through which actions could be promoted.
In reality, all the name "Palestine Action" did was provide a name to collate actions under.

## Postamble
[^defining]: 
    I use quotes here as the definition of terrorism (and, therefore, terrorist groups) will always be political.
    It is founded in the repression of violent resistance and the use of violence for a political cause.
    Of course, the definition of "violent" is up to interpretation and widens day by day.
    Definitions of terrorism also (almost always) ignore international *right to resist*, derived from the right to self-determination.[^self-determination]

[^self-determination]: Article 1(2) of the Charter of the United Nations; United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2625 (XXV).
