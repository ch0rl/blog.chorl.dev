On 14 October 2025, the U.S. Department of State (DoS) posted a selection of social media posts from visa applicants about Charlie Kirk, which led to their applications being denied or revoked.[^tweet]

## "Rest in Piss"
The DoS seem to take issue with this post's claim that Kirk "devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric".
All this person is saying is how Kirk was a terrible person and they don't care that he died.
How is that objectionable?

## "Astroturf a Movement"
The second screenshot, again, seems to be a valid critique of the far-right movement in the U.S. that speaks for itself.

## "Deserve to Die"
The first non-screenshot given is:
> A Mexican national said that Kirk “died being a racist, he died being a misogynist” and stated that “there are people who deserve to die. There are people who would make the world better off dead.”

Which is simply true: he did die being a racist and misogynist and the world is better off without him.

## "Died too Late"
Another quote given is:
> A Brazilian national charged that “Charlie Kirk was the reason for a Nazi rally where they marched in homage to him” and that Kirk “DIED TOO LATE.”

The first quote is clearly true, the second is an opinion. 
Again, no reason to revoke a visa.

## "When Fascists Die"
A German national is quoted as saying:
> when fascists die, democrats don’t complain

Which is just true? 
I thought that, if anything, WWII taught us that we should have no space in society for fascists.

## "His Own Rules"
The final quote is:
> Charlie Kirk was a son of a b\*\*\*\* and he died by his own rules

This is again true: Kirk -- a staunch pro-gun proponent -- died by gunshot.
