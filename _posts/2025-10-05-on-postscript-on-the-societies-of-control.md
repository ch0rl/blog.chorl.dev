One piece of required reading for week one of IM902 is Gilles Deleuze's _Postscript on the Societies of Control_ (May, 1990), which you can read here: [Postscript on the Societies of Control \| The Anarchist Library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/gilles-deleuze-postscript-on-the-societies-of-control).

Overall, I found this writing very dense and inaccessible, to the point of not making much sense.
It is very abstract, failing to give concrete examples and echoing the common ableism of academic writing.

## Section One: Historical
In the first paragraph of section one, Deleuze puts forth that "the individual never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having its own laws".
I take issue with this framing, though, as it feels overly simplistic.

In a sense, these closed environments -- home, school, the factory, prison, etc. -- do have their own _laws_, but this overlooks the overruling laws of the State.
For example, home, school, and work have their own disciplinary procedures, but the law of the State remains (ie., it remains unlawful to kill a person in any of these environments, punishable through the same procedure -- the courts). 

One could argue that the State acts as its own _space of enclosure_ atop the spaces described by Deleuze; we could say that the State is an _exterior_ of enclosure, and home, school, etc., are _interiors_ of enclosure.
I would go further, in discussing international law and norms, but -- of course -- they only exist as a facade that Western governments pretend to follow. 

Paragraph two sets out what I believe to be a general critique of capitalism, though I cannot be sure.

Paragraph three claims that "we are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of enclosure" and "everyone knows that these institutions [of enclosure] are finished".
To this, I ask: are they?
I note that this piece was written in 1990 -- 35 years ago -- and all of these environments remain.

The final paragraph of this section establishes that _societies of control_ are replacing these _disciplinary societies_ of the time.
As evidence of this, Deleuze cites "extraordinary pharmaceutical productions", "the molecular engineering", and "the genetic manipulations".
He also points to the example of clinics, hospices, and day care providing "new freedom", but that they could contribute to "mechanisms of control that are equal to the harshest of confinements".
I, again, struggle to understand this example.

Furthermore, one could argue that _disciplinary societies_ are *societies of control* through the threat of violence.
For example, children comply with their parents' control through the threat of being "grounded"; students comply with school rules through the threat of detention; employees comply with employer's rules through the threat of docked pay.

This paragraph does, however, provide one topical quote:[^no-comment]
> There is no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new weapons. 

## Section Two: Logic
To be written at some point, maybe.
