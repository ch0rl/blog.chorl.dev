This stems from a short discussion in IM941: Adventures in Interdisciplinary Research.

## Background
This rambling builds on Aristotle's proposition that all perception is as a result of stimulation of the senses.[^no-access][^slakey]
It then follows that the _production_ of knowledge relies on perception and, so, one's senses.

Transhumanism[^not-meta-post] -- briefly -- is a movement aiming to improve and extend one's _self_ through the use of technology and other means.
This is often portrayed through body modifications (such as RFID implants), but can be more abstract.
For example, a friend of mine and I have spoken before about how the taking of lactase to counter lactose intolerance is rather transhumanist.

Finally, the questions which these thoughts surround: 
1. Can digital means produce knowledge?
2. Is the production of knowledge inherently human?
3. Are these questions in opposition?

## Thoughts
My main thought here stems from a discussion that I have had with a friend of mine.
This friend, insofar as I understand it, views their devices -- phone, computer, etc. -- as an extension of their _self_.

Taking this, I would propose that the devices could constitute a _sense_ in Aristotle's context and, therefore, aid in perception and knowledge.
I would, therefore, say that the answer to the first question is yes.
As for the second, I would argue it is not necessary to answer; in that mind, the third answer is no.

I would propose that, regardless of whether we consider knowledge inherently human, digital means can aid in knowledge production through forming a sort of sense.
Viewing devices as an extension of one's self allows for the application of _sense perception_ theory, as well as other knowledge philosophies.
