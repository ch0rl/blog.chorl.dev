## Background
This rambling builds on Aristotle's proposition that all perception is as a result of stimulation of the senses.[^no-access][^slakey]
It then follows that the _production_ of knowledge relies on perception and, so, one's senses.

Transhumanism[^not-meta-post] -- briefly -- is a movement aiming to improve and extend one's _self_ through the use of technology and other means.
This is often portrayed through body modifications (such as RFID implants), but can be more abstract.
For example, a friend of mine and I have spoken before about how the taking of lactase to counter lactose intolerance is rather transhumanist.

Finally, the questions which these thoughts surround: 
1. Can digital means produce knowledge?
2. Is the production of knowledge inherently human?
3. Are these questions in opposition?
