In one seminar, we were tasked with creating a representation of participatory methods with Lego; this is a description of mine (full images at the end).

## About
I approached this task by thinking about how participation brings people (represented as studs) together.
My piece shows a "roundtable"-esque representation, but with emphasis on how everyone approaches participation from different places, backgrounds, privileges, and difficulties.
The mix of colours and pieces show how participation can be messy, in good ways and bad.

## Examples
### Loudspeaker
Here, a white stud is placed behind a loudspeaker, exemplifying how some people's voices are given more credence than others.
While the colour of the stud was arbitrary, I'll leave the reader to draw their own conclusions.

### Barriers
In this example, a beige stud is placed behind a block and vertical plate, showing how people can experience multiple barriers to entry and participation.

### Elevated
This example is of a blue stud, elevated much higher than the others, but also in a precarious position, showing how privilege can come crashing down.

### Hidden
Here, two studs are hidden under the main ring that connects everything.
While hidden, they are also key to supporting this central ring.
