So-called "de-arrests" take place during protests, where protestors attempt to pull a detainee away from police to prevent their formal arrest.[^legal]
This generally involves one group pulling the detainee and another getting inbetween the police and the detainee.[^de-arrest-primer]

De-arresting is inherently busy, loud, and involves touching; for me, this raises some interesting questions, specifically of consent.

1. How can we tell if someone is being detained, and not just spoken to?
2. Is it fair to assume that any detainee would like to be de-arrested?
3. How do we establish consent to touch a detainee?
4. How do crowd dynamics play into bystanders' consent?

To answer these, it is important to understand the difference between detention and arrest.
A person may be detained by a police officer to be searched, to wait for an arresting officer, or for some other reason -- importantly, they are not "free to leave".
An arrest is then typically where handcuffs are used, and the detainee is taken away.

Just as an aside: de-arrest tactics could be applied to avoid other detentions, such as "stop and search"-es which can be traumatic themselves and could lead to arrest.
I will refer solely to arrests here, though, for simplicity.

## "Am I free to leave?"
The preface to a de-arrest is identifying someone about to be -- or currently being -- arrested.
But time is an issue here: one cannot wait and see; as soon as handcuffs go on, hope for a simple de-arrest is lost.
So then, how does one figure out quickly whether someone is being detained?

You could safely assume that someone being stopped at a protest would likely mean arrest, as police tend to only stop those they _need_ to during public order incidents.
You could also look to the behaviour of the officers: is there a group of them moving as one, does one have gloves on, are they holding the person by their arm, does it look like the person is free to leave?
All of these, together, can give an idea of whether someone is about to be arrested.

For example, the below pictures show a group of officers walking towards a target (who is being pointed to) and an officer within that group putting on gloves.
Moments later, a violent arrest was attempted.

## Fair to Assume?
As an activist, my gut instinct is that yes: of course people would like to be de-arrested.
But when I stop and think, I'm left considering whether this is true.

I think, overall, the harms of arrest vastly outweigh the possible reasons to not attempt de-arrest.

### Why Arrest is (or can be) Bad


### Why Might People Say No
If a de-arrest is unsuccessful, or if the police have a way to retrospectively identify the person, they _could_ be handed extra charges (such as "obstructing an officer" contrary to [&sect;89(2) Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) or "assault with intent to resist arrest" contrary to [&sect;38 Offences against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38)).
While they could argue that they had no control over their de-arrest, but this would be an argument for court -- after an arrest, custody, possible raid, etc.

Additionally, as mentioned above, de-arrest can be very violent. 
Especially for those who identify as female, those with trauma associated with touching, or any other aversion to possible intimate contact, de-arrest could be -- on balance -- too much.
See the below image, for example, of a mid-de-arrest _scuffle_.

There may also be those who sympathise with the police, who look like they're detained but are actually talking to the police (or some other ill-advised activity).
These people, of course, would not be a good target for de-arrest, but can be pretty easily spotted (take my word for it ðŸ˜‰).

### Risks to De-Arresters
It's also worth discussing the possible risks to those performing the de-arrest (who I will refer to as the de-arresters).

On top of the above physical concerns for de-arresters, there are of course the legal risks.
The same obstruction and prevention charges above could apply, with much greater likelihood of sticking in court; this is especially possible if de-arresters are not wearing bloc[^bloc] or are otherwise identifiable.
It would be unlikely for police to attempt to arrest all de-arresters at the time, for reasons mentioned above (ask me how I know).
