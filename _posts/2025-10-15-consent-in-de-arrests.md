So-called "de-arrests" take place during protests, where protestors attempt to pull a detainee away from police to prevent their formal arrest.[^legal]
This generally involves one group pulling the detainee and another getting inbetween the police and the detainee.[^de-arrest-primer]

De-arresting is inherently busy, loud, and involves touching; for me, this raises some interesting questions, specifically of consent.

1. How can we tell if someone is being detained, and not just spoken to?
2. Is it fair to assume that any detainee would like to be de-arrested?
3. How do we establish consent to touch a detainee?
4. How do crowd dynamics play into bystanders' consent?

To answer these, it is important to understand the difference between detention and arrest.
A person may be detained by a police officer to be seached, to wait for an arresting officer, or for some other reason -- importantly, they are not "free to leave".
An arrest is then typically where handcuffs are used, and the detainee is taken away.

## "Am I free to leave?"
The preface to a de-arrest is identifying someone about to be -- or currently being -- arrested.
But time is an issue here: we cannot wait and see; as soon as handcuffs go on, hope for a simple de-arrest is lost.
So then, how do we figure out quickly whether someone is being detained?

You could assume that someone being stopped at a protest would likely mean arrest, as police tend to only stop those they need to during public order incidents.
You could also look to the behaviour of the officers: is there a group of them moving as one, does one have gloves on, are they holding the person by their arm, does it look like the person is free to leave?
All of these, together, 

## Fair to Assume?
As an activist, my gut instinct is that yes: of course people would like to be de-arrested.
But when I stop and think, I'm left considering whether this is true.

## Establishing Consent

## Crowd Dynamics

    This is all meant to be hypothetical -- as a thought experiment of some kind.
